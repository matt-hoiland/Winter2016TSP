# Winter2016TSP

## Pull instructions

As it good and proper, I have omitted, and caused to be ignored, any binaries or object files as well as any IDE specific project data.  This repository contains 100% pure code. So when initially setting up your IDE, I'd suggest first creating an empty project, then navigating to the file where the project was created, clearing out any default source files, and running the following commands:

```bash
$ git init
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/matt-hoiland/Winter2016TSP.git
$ git pull origin master
```

This is different than `$ git clone` since, `clone` will create new directories reflecting exacty what is found on this repository. Creating a VS project from an existing directory is a huge pain.  However whatever works best for you, suite yourself.
